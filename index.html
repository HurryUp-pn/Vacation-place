<h2>About me</h2>
<p>One thing about me is that I don't like change that much such as throwing or giving old stuff away. I like to travel to places are are warm or hot for vacation as I would like to go out without having to stay inside all day.
And last thing about me is that im a compeitive person on almost anything.</p>

<p>Things I like to do is travel and go to the beach in Orlando. I like the hot summer more than the cold. And I like to finish my work fast before the weekend.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I like Orlando because there's a lot to do there when you are on vacation. There are both water parks and normal parks. You can enjoy the beach which are near restaurants when you get tired or an ice-cream truck or a food will pass by once a few hours. The weather around night time during spring or summer is the best as it's never cold but warm. And the parks look completely different at night time and are 10x better in my opinion.</p>

<h3>Things to do with your family in Orlando.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Going to the beach</li>
<li>Going to the parks like universal studios or disney parks depending on how hold the other family members are.</li>
<li>Going to a water park such as volcano bay</li>
<li>Going on the city walk to buy food, look at the scenery, or go shoping.</li>
<li>Going to a resturant.</li>
</ul>
